                                    <h2>9. Portugal</h2>
                                    <p>It is located in the Southern part of Europe on the lberian Peninsula bordering Spain where Lisbon, Madeira and Algarve are the prime regions with the highest cost of residential sector.</p>

	<li>MADEIRA- &euro; 2,068 per m2</li>
	<li>ALGARVE- &euro; 2,744 per m2</li>
</ul>

<p>Other than this, the renting housing has also increased by 1.2% in May 2022 that comes out to be &euro;11.2 per m2, so renting is a lucrative option too where roughly, the investor can get &euro; 952 per month.</p>

<p>So if you plan for it, then Portuguese D7 visa is the prime concern which is accessible on the financial independent foreigners with passive income, and there are major parameters to consider in order to apply for a D7 visa.</p>

<ul>
	<li>While submitting documents, the applicant must provide a purchase or long term lease agreement.</li>
	<li>The minimum income must be &euro;705 per month or &euro;8,460 per year.</li>
	<li>Now get an individual tax number, as without this you won&rsquo;t be able to open a bank account, rent or buy real estate.</li>
</ul>

<p>So considering the appreciation and demand, Portugal is again one of the best locations for the new investors to come and invest for impressive rental and to have secured property for life.</p>
