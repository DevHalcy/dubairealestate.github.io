                                    <h2>Costa Rica</h2>
                                    <p>Vacation Home in Costa Rica is one of the most searched keywords on the web, especially in the Central America region. Tropical weather, a long list of outdoor activities and flourishing communities work as a magnet for vacation home buyers in Costa Rica.&nbsp;</p>

<p>There are countless reasons behind the craze for properties in Costa Rica like peace &amp; tranquillity, vivid green jungle, easy &amp; 100% foreign ownership, simple &amp; transparent property buying process, very affordable property tax, stable &amp; growing economy etc.&nbsp;</p>

<p><img alt="Costa Rica" src="https://www.admin.dubaihousing-ae.com/img/blogs/16721452101589035054.webp" style="height:450px; width:650px" /></p>

<p>In the last few years, approx 50% of property buyers in Costa Rica purchased properties for vacation homes and rental income. Most of the property buyers use their properties as vacation homes for a few days or weeks and the rest of the time for rental income.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Now the biggest question is - what can I expect as a foreigner vacation home buyer?&nbsp;</p>

<p>If we study recent real estate trends in Costa Rica then you can expect a 5 - 8% annual return on investment in vacation homes. According to the local real estate advisors, a well-maintained holiday home in Costa Rica is reserved approx 230 days of the year for rent. And if you choose the best location with eye-catching views then these numbers can climb.&nbsp;</p>

                                    <h2>Turkey</h2>
                                    <p>This country is always on the wishlist of travellers thanks to the pleasant climate, abundance of natural views, a perfect mixture of Western Asia and Southern Europe culture and Historical monuments. So there are a lot of opportunities for vacation home seekers in Turkey.</p>

<p>Affordable property prices are one of the biggest attractions. In comparison to France, Spain and Portugal, real estate investment here provide excellent value for money.&nbsp;</p>

<p><img alt="Turkey" src="https://www.admin.dubaihousing-ae.com/img/blogs/16721452601746234717.webp" style="height:450px; width:650px" /></p>

<p>Before the Covid era, the average yearly transactions in residential property were 40,000 to 50,000 by foreigners. At that time this country was ranked among the top 10 holiday destinations in the world. Currently, Turkey Real Estate has experienced a big jump in property prices and if you are planning to buy a vacation home in Turkey then this is the right time.&nbsp;</p>

                                                            <article id="Croatia" class="blog_content">
                                    <h2>Croatia</h2>
                                    <p>Cultural heritage with a perfect dose of warmth and hospitality of Croatian citizens not only attracts a large number of travellers but vacation home seekers from around the world. Now many real estate investors including businessmen, popular celebrities as well as common men are eager to buy a vacation home in Croatia.&nbsp;</p>

<p><img alt="Croatia" src="https://www.admin.dubaihousing-ae.com/img/blogs/1672145331275305082.webp" style="height:450px; width:650px" /></p>

<p><strong>But, but, but&hellip;</strong></p>

<p>Before you think or plan to buy a holiday home in Croatia, it is better to check if you are allowed to do so or not. If you are Croatian then definitely you can buy any property here. If you are a citizen of EU member states then you may have to fulfil some obligations and then you can buy property here.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>But if you do not belong to EU member states then things may not work for you. Because this country only allows investors from nations with a reciprocity agreement to buy property in Croatia. So, check the list of eligible countries and if you are not there then you have to look for other options.&nbsp;</p>

                                                            <article id="Portugal" class="blog_content">
                                    <h2>Portugal</h2>
                                    <p>Just like other travelling destinations, Portugal is also famous for its pleasant climate, beautiful beaches &amp; seashores, and friendly people. And the best thing is that there is no additional paper requirement for foreigners who want to buy property. That&rsquo;s why it is the best option for foreigners who are looking for vacation homes.&nbsp;</p>

<p><img alt="Portugal" src="https://www.admin.dubaihousing-ae.com/img/blogs/16721453711147961362.webp" style="height:450px; width:650px" /></p>

<p>These foreign vacation home buyers are not only looking for a destination to enjoy their stay during holidays but also for a residential property to invest in. According to real estate agents in Portugal, investors from many central European countries like Germany, Belgium, Dutch &amp; France etc. preferred to buy holiday homes here in secluded areas. German holiday home buyers already hold approx 15% share in the total number of transactions. Most of the buyers preferred luxury properties like detached townhouses with traditional interiors &amp; exterior design and eye-catching views of the sea or green.</p>

<p>Residential property price in the 2nd quarter of 2022 has seen a jump of 0.5% compared to the 1st quarter of the same year, and a surge in the rental of 1.5%. So, this is the best time to buy a vacation home in Portugal.</p>

                                    <h2>Malta</h2>
                                    <p>This island country is part of the EU and is well known for pleasant summer holidays with plenty of beaches, eye-catching views, partying, seafood and every ingredient of a memorable vacation. Malta is reachable from Europe and English is one of the official languages in this country. People from Europe and other English-speaking countries feel comfortable here.

                                    <p>This is one of the few most preferred hotspots for Americans &amp; Europeans to buy vacation homes.

<p>According to real estate investment advisors, &ldquo;buying a vacation home in Belize is easier than in your own country. As you know that Belize has a history of British colonialism so the property buying procedures are almost like the UK and USA.&rdquo; This is a rising real estate &amp; tourism market and with a vacation home in Belize, you can hit two targets with the same arrow.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>But why?</strong></p>

The property buying process is easy &amp; transparent just like for Panamanians. As well as, there are many rules &amp; regulations in Panama for the protection of the rights of foreigners.&nbsp;</p>
