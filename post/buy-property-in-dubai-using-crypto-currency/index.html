                                    <p>Countless types of cryptocurrencies are available in the market but in the huge list Bitcoin is the first and most known.

                                    <h2>Know How Smoothly Cryptocurrency Works </h2>
                                    <p><strong>(1) Pick the most acceptable option:</strong>&nbsp;Choose from the numerous available varieties of villas, townhouses, and apartments. Connect with the team from where you want to purchase and check out all the options and locations fulfilling your needs.</p>

<p>Finalized your property? Move to the payment.</p>

<p><strong>(2) Pay at convenience:&nbsp;</strong>You need to complete the payment for the final purchase, then you can transfer the cryptocurrency whether it&rsquo;s Bitcoin, Ethereum, USDT, or Cardano.</p>

<p>Payment made? Now the property is yours.</p>

<p><strong>(3) You got the ownership:</strong>&nbsp;Well, you have chosen the property; made the payment; now collect the ownership documentation for the final shot. Then it is completely your choice whether you want to live, rent or another thing.</p>

<p>Do whatever you want to do with your property.</p>

<p><strong>Key Concept&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>Cryptocurrencies use a technology called public-private key cryptography to transfer coin ownership on a secure and distributed ledger. A private key is an ultra-secure password that never needs to be shared with anyone, with which you can send value on the network. An associated public key can be freely and safely shared with others to receive value on the network. From the public key, no one can guess your private key.</p>

                                    <p>Though the payment is secured in its means, still there was the need for some Government initiatives. The government came up with several blockchain projects in the past years like the Dubai Blockchain Strategy in 2016 and the Emirates Blockchain Strategy.</p>

<p>The new technologies saved a lot of time and resources. Projects like these showed that the country should have advanced governmental efficiency and development with leadership. The main aim behind the Blockchain strategy initiated by Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum is to make Dubai flourish.</p>

<p>In fact, in cryptocurrency, there is no need for any bureaucracy to conduct any business. Even blockchain is going to be used in real estate to register and&nbsp;<strong><a href="../../index.html">buy property in Dubai</a>.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Let&rsquo;s know some of the most successful blockchain initiatives (listed down are the most interesting ones).</strong></p>

<p><strong>(1) SMART DUBAI:</strong>&nbsp;The project included the blend of Blockchain, AI, interactive dashboards, big data, and smart contracts aiming to make Dubai the city of the future.</p>

<p><strong>(2) DUBAI BANKS:</strong>&nbsp;Several Dubai banks are using the Blockchain system including Emirates NBD and Mashreq Bank. The new technologies will improve and enhance security by eliminating fraud cheques and transactions.</p>

<p><strong>(3) DUBAI PAY:&nbsp;</strong>It was also an initiative for Smart Dubai that allowed the residents to pay online for all the government services. It comes under the control of the Dubai Smart Government.</p>

                                    <p>Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum- the ruler, vice-president, and prime minister of the United Arab Emirates (UAE) on March 9, announced on his official Twitter account that UAE has adopted its first law to regulate crypto assets.</p>

<p>The Government enacted Law No. 4 of 2022 on the Regulation of Virtual Assets (VAL) and established the Dubai Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority (VARA). This legal framework is a milestone reflecting Dubai&#39;s aim of becoming one of the leading jurisdictions for entrepreneurs and investors of blockchain technology. This law enactment will promote Dubai&#39;s position as a top-notch destination in the virtual asset sphere.</p>

<p><strong><img alt="" src="https://www.dubaihousing-ae.com/img/blog/6210_02.webp" /></strong></p>

<p>Rashid Al Maktoum said in the tweet, &lsquo;We established an independent authority to oversee the development of the best business environment in the world of virtual assets in terms of regulation, licensing, and governance&rsquo;.</p>

<p><strong>VARA will be overlooking the regulations in different ways:</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>It will be dedicated to overseeing the crypto activities</li>
	<li>It will serve as a regulator to the related service providers</li>
	<li>It will be authorizing and regulating the VASPs- Virtual Asset Service Providers</li>
	<li>It will ensure the highest standards of protection of data</li>
	<li>It will monitor the virtual asset transactions</li>
</ul>
