The choices are dwelling but seemingly creating confusion. It has become very difficult for home searchers to fix a property for themselves because of the enticing price, amenities, features, and locations of the property being planned. Well, the most basic confusion arises in determining the type whether you should own a condo or a townhouse or a villa and more!<br />
&nbsp;<br />
With the increasing popularity, I think condos and townhouses are in a race against each other. So it becomes mandatory for me to tell each of the details and differences of the type between both. Hope this helps you to finally make a decision in choosing the best property in Dubai.</p>

                                    <h2>What Is A Condo?</h2>
                                    <p>A condo or short form of a condominium is cheaper than a townhouse. It is the salable unit within a larger community or high-rise building. It is a good option for those who want to keep maintenance at bay- this property asks for the least maintenance of all types. Everything is managed by the condo association- leakages, repairs, etc.</p>

<p>Condos are perfect for first-time home buyers, singles, older homeowners, &amp; frequent travelers. It comes with an extra level of security with doormen. The condo fee or HOA has to be paid by you and your neighbor.</p>

                                    <h2>What Is A Townhouse?</h2>
                                    <p>Townhouses are costlier than condos but cheaper than a single-family home; these come with more spacious plans. These are often described as narrow, multilevel residences attached to others. The townhouse is about shared exterior walls with the neighboring homes; some even have patios. Townhouses also come with HOA rules and fees.</p>

<p>It is a good idea to own a new &amp; modern townhouse to avoid the extra fees of repair and maintenance instead of the older one.&nbsp; It gives a hybrid living experience. You have complete ownership. In comparison of condo vs. townhouse resale value of the latter is higher.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>With The Difference Between Condo And Townhouses Each One Has Its Pros And Cons.</strong></p>
                                </article>
                                                            <article id="AdvantagesOfCondos" class="blog_content">
                                    <h2>Advantages Of Condos</h2>
                                    <ul>
	<li>Condos are affordable because they are smaller in size and seem an attractive option for first-time homebuyers</li>
	<li>Condo communities are located near the city centers making the amenities easily accessible; more amenities in the condo community like the rooftop recreation area, fitness center</li>
	<li>Being an owner of the condo doesn&rsquo;t mean you have to maintain the common area in &amp; out that&rsquo;s the condo association&rsquo;s job.</li>
	<li>A condo is a cost-effective way that is usually placed in a brimming location. It brings you near the social features and civic amenities; additionally convenient public connectivity option.</li>
	<li>These are considered flexible property types as they can be used as vacation homes, for friends and families; buying and selling condos is not a big deal.</li>
</ul>

<h3><strong>Disadvantages Of Condos</strong></h3>

<ul>
	<li>If you are someone who loves privacy then a condo isn&rsquo;t a perfect fit for you as you&rsquo;ll live close to other residents</li>
	<li>Condo owners are responsible for paying the HOA fees including all the maintenance charges, security, etc.</li>
	<li>You will be living under certain restrictions and adhere to the association&rsquo;s rules. Surely you own a unit but will still live under some rules.</li>
</ul>
                                </article>
                                                            <article id="AdvantagesOfTownhouses" class="blog_content">
                                    <h2>Advantages Of Townhouses</h2>
                                    <ul>
	<li>The townhouses is usually spacious bringing more space through big and wide floor plans, garages, patio, and more.</li>
	<li>It is the best option if someone wants to enjoy the best of both the world like a single-family home covering the aspects of a condo</li>
	<li>Townhouses are generally considered perfect for families looking for a bigger space or I can say this property is perfect for the bigger families</li>
	<li>It is an amazing option to be bought as an investment for the singles and first-time homebuyers can also purchase townhouses as they can look forward to big and wide living.</li>
</ul>

<h3><strong>Disadvantages Of Townhouses</strong></h3>

<ul>
	<li>A townhouse area is larger in comparison to condos and thus generally takes more maintenance.</li>
	<li>The townhouse is planned in more area and comes with more space; this means you live a little away from the city life, which means you cannot access social amenities in a jiffy.</li>
	<li>It comes with shared walls and still does not gives you the desired privacy.</li>
</ul>

<h3><strong>How To Choose What&rsquo;s Best For You? Hope The Difference Between Condo And Townhouse Has Helped&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>Property investment includes so many factors but it all starts with the size of the family. You are the only one who knows how many rooms and spaces you want for your family.</p>

<p>Then it is your budget where you need to fix an amount that you can spend and make sure this doesn&rsquo;t make any hole in the pocket. Once you are fixed with your budget then only you can evaluate which property is suitable for you.</p>

<p>Then the lifestyle you want to lead also helps you segregate the right option. If you can afford high maintenance then go for a townhouse else you can go for a condo. This also determines whether you will be living close to the social amenities of the city or not.</p>

<h3><strong>Who Should Buy What? Which Type Is Suitable For You?</strong></h3>

<p>Well, there isn&rsquo;t any possible way that you go into debt, compromise your basic living, and then own a home. But the decision to buy a townhouse or a condo often comes down to cost, lifestyle, and comfort.</p>

<p>The millennial generation usually the beginner prefers investment through a condo. With less experience, they can&rsquo;t go for a huge amount.</p>

<p>Then come the established buyers who often have growing families and need bigger space for a living then a townhouse is the best suitable option. Older adults usually prefer townhouses.</p>

<h3><strong>Amenities To Be Obtained In A Townhouse Or Condo</strong></h3>

<p>Amenities have become an imperative part of the construction. Every housing these days is being planned in a way that brings comfort and luxuries. Both the townhouse and condo offer a myriad of amenities to the residents of that specific housing. It generates more interest from the buyers and makes living very convenient. The residents can enjoy so much with a variety of fun, leisure, and pleasure activities in the enticing neighborhood.</p>
                                </article>
                                                            <article id="AmenitiesYouCanEnjoy" class="blog_content">
                                    <h2>Amenities You Can Enjoy</h2>
                                    <p><strong>1.&nbsp;Swimming pool:</strong>&nbsp;What can be better than chilling in the pool with your loved ones? Looking at the demand and the growing interest most housing type is coming up with a swimming pool and it is suitable for every generation as well.</p>

<p><strong>2. Entertainment amenities:</strong>&nbsp;Your rooftop area, garden, or terraces are the perfect choice for entertainment. Like the Barbeque areas, gaming zones, etc. you can sit, dine and wine with your friends and family.</p>

<p><strong>3.&nbsp;Fitness concern:&nbsp;</strong>Well the residential properties these days are imbibed with the best fitness facilities. Be it a well-equipped gym, well-maintained yoga room, meditation center, or more, the homes have a few or at least of these.</p>

<p><strong>4.<strong> </strong>Lavish clubhouse:&nbsp;</strong>Clubhouse is another common but luxurious amenity. Commonly seen these days but are filled with an array of amenities. The clubhouse is basically a common area to sit, gather and enjoy different activities.</p>

<p><strong>5. Security:</strong>&nbsp;It is an added amenity commonly seen. Even if you are not living in a gated community, still you can access the security steps with a security guard. Your vicinity will be safe with guards and doormen. This is very common to see in urban areas.</p>

<h3><strong>HOA For Condo And Townhouse</strong></h3>

<p>This is an important difference to note between the two types. In both the types of properties condos and townhouses homeowners associations collect the payments from residents. But HOAs for a condo are hugely higher than the HOAs of the townhouse.</p>

<h3><strong>Condo Vs Townhouse Resale Value</strong></h3>

<p>The resale value of the condos and townhouses isn&rsquo;t as much as expected because HOA limits that. You can&rsquo;t make many changes according to your will- this limitation brings the resale value down. This is where it becomes mandatory to look for the property i.e. placed at the strategic location and stay updated with HOA who keeps the property up-to-the-mark adding a strong impression on the property searchers.</p>

<p>Needless to say, location plays an imperative role in boosting property value. A beautiful home that is complete, and free from all problems will automatically bring good value.</p>
