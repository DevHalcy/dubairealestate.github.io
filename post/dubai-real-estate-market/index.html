                                    <p>&ldquo;Attracting FDI to the tune of $ 4.3 billion at a time when the world is still recovering from the pandemic-induced slowdown is something very reassuring,&rdquo; opines Rakesh Menon, former global senior vice president, JP Morgan Bank based out of London.&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
According to the industry and the financial experts, in terms of FDI attraction, Dubai ranks first in the Arab world and third globally which means it is heading and already facing an economic boom. Dubai&#39;s political leadership is one of the main reasons behind the economic growth.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Interestingly, Dubai&#39;s FDI Capital flow has been recorded as $ 4.3 billion from 371 projects in the first 9 months of 2021, tremendous growth has been observed. It is a good recovery post-pandemic and something reassuring the market to come up phenomenally.<br />

                                    <p>Looking at the history of the Dubai real estate market it has seen cycles. From a very attractive market, it has seen the lowest phase as well. Like 2005 witnessed the peak and then 2008 witnessed the total crash. It again took a rise and recovered by overcoming all the flaws with 2014 again coming as the highest time to face the crash again in 2018. It was a slow-down again, then a pandemic came and the market shook once again but this time it started recovering soon in 2021. This time it came with a bang with the most attractive options from the builder&rsquo;s side, government initiatives attracting investors, and the countries taking interest in Dubai real estate.<br />

                                    <p>Needless to say that Dubai real estate market is attracting people from all over the Globe. Not just the country UAE but many countries are showing interest in Dubai real estate. But what exactly are the reasons for the Dubai property market attracting investors? Let&rsquo;s know some below.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<strong>Fetch Higher Annual Rental Yields</strong></p>

<p>Well, the top-notch real estate consulting firm revealed that Dubai properties give an average yearly return of 5.19% and this is quite higher in comparison to other countries which are not even crossing 3%. <a href="../../index.html"><strong>Dubai Housing</strong></a> is marketing new and better possibilities with better returns.</p>

<p>&ldquo;CBRE, the real estate consultant, said that price and rent increases have been seen in 2021 and 2022 as well, the price and rent improvement is expected according to a report by S&amp;P Global Ratings.&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<strong>Per Square Meter Price Is Lower</strong></p>

<p>Other international cities are offering prices per square meter higher than Dubai thus attracting more investors to make a beneficial investment. In comparison of other countries like Hong Kong (US $28,570), London (US$ 26,262) New York ($17,191) Tel Aviv ($17,149) Geneva ($16,467) Tokyo ($ 16,322), Paris ($15,867) &amp; Berlin ($7,325), Dubai is having price US $5,918 that makes the cost of property buying lesser than any other.</p>

<p><strong>Dubai Is A Safe Country</strong></p>

<p>Dubai is known for its strict laws and coming up as the safest region around the Globe. It is a top choice for investors and especially women, who feel safe living, working, and enjoying living here. UAE is the 2nd safest country in the world whereas other competitive countries are in no comparison to it according to the Global Finance Magazine.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Alliance Business Advisors, a leading consulting firm has presented a report that the average price of a home in Dubai costs AED 1 million (US$ 272,000), which is again lesser in comparison to US$ 1.2 million in Hong Kong, US$ 1 Million in Munich, US $ 915,000 in Singapore, $ 650,555 in Paris, and $ 649,026 in New York.&rdquo;<br />
<br />
<strong>Free From Tax</strong></p>

<p>Well, Dubai is the country with zero property tax. Whether you are purchasing property and filing the income tax returns you have 0% tax on properties. Zero property tax is another beautiful reason why Dubai is a favored choice for international investors. Whereas in other countries people have to pay a good amount of tax like the UK (2.53%) France (1.70 %), Greece (1.50 %) Iceland (1.48 %), and Italy (0.71 %), as per International Tax Competitiveness Index (ITCI).&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Easy Obtaining Residency Visa</strong></p>

<p>Real Estate in Dubai is gaining attraction also because of the residency visa for the global investors. The UAE government has brought out the new visa laws directly linked to the property investments providing quick options for residency and then investment. In fact, the Golden Visa has boosted the spirit of investment here.</p>

<p><strong>Outstanding Visa Reforms</strong></p>

<p>Dubai&#39;s real estate market is booming and in 2019 with the introduction of long-term and renewable <a href="../golden-visa-rules-uae/index.html"><strong>Golden Visa</strong></a> for several categories of people.
