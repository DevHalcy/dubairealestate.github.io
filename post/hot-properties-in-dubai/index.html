                                <p>In Dubai real estate where housing options are vast still, most home seekers &amp; investors prefer villas &amp; townhouses and we have a huge amount of Data &amp; figures to validate this fact. But first of all, we want to make you clear about the difference between Villas &amp; Townhouses. One of the biggest differences between a villa and a townhouse is mainly their look. Townhouses share common walls with another unit and are generally smaller in sizes, not more than 3 &amp; 4 Bedroom. On the other hand, a villa seems like an independent standalone unit with private amenities &amp; features.</p>

<p>The property market of Dubai has started the current year on a high note. The first quarter of 2022 has produced record-breaking numbers of 17, 896 sales transactions (81% more QoQ) which convert into AED 42,856,090,253 (125% more QoQ) in value, concluding the best first quarter ever in the Dubai property market.&nbsp;</p>

                                    <h2>Why Villas and Townhouses For Sale In Dubai Are Hot Properties?</h2>
                                    <ul>
	<li>A huge alteration has been seen in the preference of homebuyers in Dubai for instance demand for gated-community, and open spaces is navigating property buyers towards luxury villas &amp; townhouses.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Townhouses/Villas for sale in Dubai are offering high-capital appreciation than luxury apartments.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Reforms in UAE&rsquo;s visa policies are one of the biggest reasons behind the huge leap in demand for property for sale in Dubai</li>
</ul>

<p>Many reputed real estate developers in Dubai such as Damac Properties, Emaar Properties and Sobha Realty have introduced the best offers &amp; payment plans to attract potential home buyers &amp; real estate investors. These offers &amp; payment plans are Dubai Land Department registration fee waivers, different types of favorable payment plans for the buyers and continuously increasing sales. Very hopefully property developers in this region will continue to present these types of offers &amp; schemes to attract home buyers.&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<strong>According to real estate investment experts, a big portion of the overall property sales in Dubai is covered by off-plan property.&nbsp;</strong><br />
&nbsp;<br />
As well, waterfront communities from globally reputed builders are arousing particular interest among both buyers and investors. One more reason which we would like to mention here as a residential property demand booster is the freelance visa. By acquiring a freelance visa you can live in UAE as a self-employed person and you can also sponsor your children, life partner, and parents.&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
According to real estate investment experts in Dubai, the growth rate of property value is estimated to be more than 2% in 2022. At present, numerous residential properties are under development and will be ready to move on shortly. This trend of development of new properties in Dubai will continue in the coming years.&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
The boost in Dubai&#39;s real estate market was channeled by high liquidity, affordable interest rates, and relocation to the United Arab Emirates. During the last couple of years, Dubai has seen more ex-pats shift to its peripheries for different reasons, a tax-friendly system, and a business-friendly environment. At the same time, other countries have limited access to non-residents; Dubai unlocked its gates and welcomed home seekers, investors, and businesses from all over the world.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
All these initiatives and more created momentum in home seekers&rsquo; decisions. In the face of opposite circumstances created by price rises, pandemics, and a huge rise in interest rates, Dubai&rsquo;s property market observed a strong growth. In Dubai, enthusiasm and home seekers&rsquo; confidence remained strong, mainly in the middle of the elite class.&nbsp;</p>

On the whole, what we are observing in the real estate market of Dubai is that there are huge searches for luxury villas &amp; townhouses with swimming pools &amp; private amenities, over apartments. This transformation in demand is influenced by numerous factors. Lockdown measures have forced home-seekers to reconsider their living requirements and independent villas &amp; townhouses in Dubai are a perfect choice. With affordable property prices &amp; rentals on the outskirts, many property seekers are in many cases also able to afford bigger &amp; luxurious homes. As well, different initiatives are taken by the UAE government to support this trend.</p>
