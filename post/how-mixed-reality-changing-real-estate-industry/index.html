                                    <h2>Benefits of Mixed Reality in Real Estate - Knowing all in important</h2>
                                    <p>Mixed reality has brought so many benefits and the most important one is Immersive Experience. With the amalgamation of environment and 3D models, an immersive experience can be created that is most used by real estate agents and developers. It helps in selling the property in a completely new manner by providing them with a virtual tour of the home giving an insight into what a home looks like.</p>

<p>MR enables the clients to envisage their future home and ask for changes wherever required. On one project and at one time, multiple stakeholders can come together. This brings ease to the purchase where the client can get the full idea about the location, property, interior designs, etc., and can ask for changes in the ongoing construction to bring out the perfect piece. This will let you end up making a profitable and good investment.</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Properties can be shown remotely</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>What can be better than staying at home and viewing what you own? Well, I think looking at the current hot weather, nobody wants to step out and explore the property from the front. Then MR has brought a solution for you where builders and the agents can give a guided tour to the clients specifying the significant features and buyers can put all the inquiries. Even remotely you can get a clear perspective of the property you are interested in.</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Virtual Visits are not so boring anymore</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>Have you ever seen a view from the top or something giving a 360-degree view? How did it feel? Did you like it? I mean getting a 360-degree view gives you the whole idea of surroundings, beauty, and flaws. Now with the mixed reality headsets and other applications, you can get a complete view and experience the whole space. Clients love this delightful experience that gives the feeling of fulfillment providing the satisfaction of what home they will own and the facilities added. Virtual visits through MR are a beautiful experience.</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Location-based experience</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>Virtual Reality though brought so many benefits but still was restricted to a zone and that is basically related to the obstacles in the physical environment with respect to safety concerns. It was the challenge the VR was having.</p>

<p>&nbsp;Microsoft is investing heavily in MR that will transform the workplace, especially places like manufacturing facilities and production studios. Engineers and other professionals can use products like Dynamics 365 to glean greater amounts of 3D data from simulations using MR. Coworkers can get expert instruction remotely using an MR experience that allows them to annotate the virtual space around them in the same way people mark up Google Docs.</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Customize according to your likes &amp; dislikes</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>As said above you get a complete view of the property through MR, which means you can also extract the changes you need and can ask the seller or the developer to implement them. This can help in determining the final look of the property. In fact, you can make the best decision by choosing others over what was already going on in your mind. Real estate developers have so many properties to showcase ranging in several prices, so ask for customization according to price and need.</p>

                                    <h2>How mixed reality will improve real estate experience? Use-cases of MR</h2>

<p>Technology is evolving and is opening palatial space for the industry to grow. It is combining the virtual and real world by providing a completely natural look. The expansion in this field is beyond marketing and beyond your thoughts.</p>

<p>Have you ever imagined looking at a property with the combined aspects of the physical and digital world?</p>

<p>That is the power technology has and this has come out in the name of Mixed Reality. Forget about Virtual reality and augmented reality, MR will blow your mind. Let&rsquo;s know the use-cases of Mixed Reality in the real estate industry.</p>

<p><strong>1.&nbsp;</strong><strong>Locating and accessing properties</strong></p>

<p>When it comes to searching for the best property option then you need to do so much research and visit sites. This makes the whole process so much complex, tiring, and long. Instead of spending weeks and months finding the property better make the process simpler with mixed reality.</p>

<p>From your own location, you can sit and enjoy the property tour and with the help of holographic technology you can check out the site map as well. Buyers get a great opportunity to own property without visiting.</p>

<p>Example: A realtor in New York, Mark, uses HoloLens to enable his clients to view commercial properties in 3D.</p>

<p><strong>2.&nbsp;</strong><strong>Visualize property in 3D holograms</strong></p>

<p>Well, this gives an outstanding and eye-catching view of the property remotely. MR devices like HoloLens provide an impressive view of the properties. Clients can get a complete visual from the device and get the feel of a real view with customized and personalized examples. HoloLens is an amazing tool for the real estate industry replacing costly home showcasing and saving time from visits.</p>

<p><strong>3.&nbsp;</strong><strong>Photorealistic architectural visuals</strong></p>

<p>How about visualizing the architectural plans coming real in front of your eyes? Well, that is definitely going to take time in real life but with the help of MR technology, you can visualize the architectural plan in real. The devices completely change the feel of the entire space and everything seems to be real.</p>

<p>Example: Using HoloLens, Lowe&#39;s, for example, provides customers with an interactive, visually rich way to see hologram kitchen options.</p>

<p><strong>4.&nbsp;</strong><strong>Virtual interior decorating</strong></p>

<p>Interior decoration has always been the main concern for the people shifting in the ready to move in apartments; or for the projects under construction. You just get an idea with the pictures and videos presented by the developer but do that turns out to be the same as promised? But with the help of MR technology you enable the buyer to virtually experience the space where they can check the beautiful interior decoration.</p>

<p>Example: The IKEA Place app, for instance, offers its customers the opportunity to virtually decorate their own living space before making a purchase.</p>

<p><strong>5.&nbsp;</strong><strong>Property specs and data</strong></p>

<p>With real-time data and visuals, you can determine the property more accurately. You can get accurate dimensions and functionality with correct measurements and stats with various tools. This allows the buyers to visualize properties with all the specifications and if you need any changes you are allowed to do that in real-time.</p>

<p><strong>Merits of MR technology</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>Increased conversion rates</li>
	<li>Saves time, energy, and money</li>
	<li>Enhanced level of visualization</li>
	<li>Augmented viewings of the real estate market</li>
	<li>Demonstrations round the globe</li>
	<li>Customization as per your choices</li>
</ul>
