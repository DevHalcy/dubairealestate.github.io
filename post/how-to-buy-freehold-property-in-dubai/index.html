                                <p>Dubai real estate has made a strong niche globally where it has recorded 43.2K transactions which costs AED 115 Billion and yearly it will show a 60% growth in sales volume and 87.8 % in sales value.&nbsp;</p>

<p>So the above data creates a rope of trust where investment ideas in Dubai will never turn into a fiasco. And you will be surprised to know that foreigners were not allowed to buy any type of property in Dubai until the government commenced a Property Law in 2002 &ldquo;Allowing Freehold Property Ownership&rdquo; for foreigners.</p>

<p>So it was a farfetched dream for the outsiders to think about real estate investment in Dubai. And now the story is all different where it creates a leeway for the investors to park their capital in a freehold property.&nbsp;</p>
