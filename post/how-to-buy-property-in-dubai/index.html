                                    <h2>4. What is the total time taken? Is it a long process?</h2>
                                    <p>Once the final agreement has been signed, it takes around 30 days to complete the process of transactions.</p>

<p>The process starts with your search for property in Dubai and once you have found the property of your choice then a Memorandum of Understanding is signed and a deposit payment of around 10% is made. Then comes the process of NOC- No Objection Certificate between the buyer and seller for the final sale of the property. Once you have paid the fees the buyer or the developer will happily issue the NOC and also when the buyer is assured about the buyer&rsquo;s funds that he/she can buy the property or not. Make sure you have all the funds in front of you before you plan for any property purchase in Dubai otherwise your NOC may be declined.</p>

<p>This process gets further with the transfer of NOC to the DLD- <a href="https://dubailand.gov.ae/en/"><strong>Dubai Land Department</strong></a> with which the ownership of the property is transferred. The price is paid in the form of the manager&rsquo;s cheque with the transferable date. Then you&rsquo;ll be issued the land deed in your name.</p>

                                    <p>Buying property with a mortgage in Dubai is a tricky task as your NOC can be rejected until and unless your bank and the lender have sufficient funds to pay for your property. Straight cash buy allows you to quickly buy the property whereas buying with a mortgage will take a longer time than usual.</p>
