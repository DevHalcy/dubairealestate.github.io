                                <p><strong>How does it feel like work from home?</strong></p>

<p>I feel if it is done with a proper schedule then it is good but if not then it feels like a burden because achieving tasks in WFH is like catching a pie in the sky and sometimes it feels like spring to life.</p>

<p>In a bid to reduce the spread of Covid-19, the UAE government took the step of allowing Working from Home in Dubai.</p>

But there are a few things to keep in mind while making the setup that it does not affect your productivity. This need to have all the equipment that you work on peacefully and allows you to communicate with your team without any interruption. Mini-office at home increase your productivity, you have to stay away from distractions.</p>

Similarly, the workspace should be planned in a manner that it stays exclusively for work.

Work-life should be different from personal life- try as much as possible.</p>

	<li>Keep it cluttered free ensuring a healthy environment</li>
	<li>Don&rsquo;t keep anything distracting you</li>

                                    <h2>Proper Sitting Arrangement Is A Must - Don’t Let Anything Affect Your Health </h2>
                                    <p>Well, I have explained that proper sitting position is important but for that having proper sitting arrangement is a must. It seems so tempting that you just need to pull a chair and sit as per your convenience when working from home. But that is not a good idea until and unless you have proper back support to sit for long hours. Make such an arrangement that it supports your neck and eyes, sit so your spine should be in a neutral position, etc. If you make a wrong choice then it is just painful! Avoid sitting in a wrong position that does not favor your back and neck.</p>

<ul>
	<li>Take proper work desk with few drawers</li>
	<li>Take an ergonomic chair to support and comfort your body</li>
	<li>Add a cushion supporting your posture&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />
	&nbsp;</li>

Who can sit in a dirty space? I mean how do you keep the clutter accumulated at the place where you are working. This is the most important tip that goes hand in hand with your need to keep the workspace or home office neat and clean. One of the most common downsides is that you should keep your food/snack plates, and coffee/tea mugs back in the original space. Just take out some time for yourself and get rid of the crumbs and dust of the space- 10 minutes are more than enough to clean and wipe the mess.</p>

<ul>
	<li>Avoid gathering stacks of paper</li>
	<li>Do dusting the work desk daily</li>
	<li>Keep all the documents arranged</li>
	<li>Don&rsquo;t leave the coffee cups and spills on the desk</li>
</ul>

Greenery is always soothing and the thing that lifts the mood. By adding a little greenery to your workspace you can make the environment healthy and soothing. A cute little potted plant is enough that will add a small green patch to your workspace. The increased level of oxygen released by that plant helps in stimulating the brain. It is also something to add freshness and brighten the look of the workspace. Plants have manifold benefits like it reduce stress, increasing productivity, reducing sickness, boosting creativity, etc.</p>

<ul>
	<li>Keep a flowing stem of money plant</li>
	<li>Put a little pot with a small plant in it</li>
	<li>Add a fresh flower daily spreading the fragrance<br />

Wrap up your work at the right time and walk away from the workspace when you are done with the work. You will be burning yourself in work pressure.
