<p>Now you may be doubtful about Federal Corporate Tax in UAE that will be effective from 1st June 2023. One thing here we want to make sure that Dubai&#39;s real estate market has been unaffected by this Federal Corporate Tax. So you can buy property here as you won&rsquo;t have to keep paying some percentage of earnings from the property.</p>

<p><strong>High standard of living</strong></p>

<p>A couple of centuries back Dubai was a fishing village with a population of approx 800 - 1000. This city has emerged over time and is now globally recognized as one of the best cities thanks to its high standard of living and modern infrastructure. Dubai has every ingredient required for a global city &amp; lifestyle hub like the best hotels, multi-cuisines dining options, beautiful beaches, entertainment &amp; recreational zones.</p>

<p>When it comes to property in Dubai, real estate developers like Emaar Properties, Damac Properties and Sobha Realty etc. are offering different options for luxury residential properties in the best areas. And the best thing is that residential properties in Dubai are quite affordable in comparison to other top cities of the world, which means here you can buy affordable luxury properties.</p>

<p><strong>Safety</strong></p>

<p>When we talk about safety in Dubai, we are actually talking about two different types of safety (Individual Safety and Buyers/Investors&#39; Interest Safety). This is one of the biggest factors to attract home buyers &amp; investors. This city is known to be one of the safest cities in the world not only for the residents but for travellers too. As it has a very low crime rate, thanks to the efficient legal system and strict rules &amp; regulations for the violators.</p>

<p>To protect the interest of real estate investors &amp; home buyers, there is a strong regulatory framework under DLD (Dubai Land Department). One of the enticing factors that make Dubai stand apart is the most transparent &amp; well-managed property market in MENA (the Middle East &amp; North Africa) region. So, everyone feels safe here&hellip;</p>

<p><strong>World-class Infrastructure</strong></p>

<p>One thing is clear, world-class infrastructure &amp; innovation helps Dubai&rsquo;s economy and population to rise at outstanding rates. When it comes to infrastructure development then what&rsquo;s not there - like the world&rsquo;s tallest buildings, biggest malls and largest airports etc. This emirate city of UAE is also one of the biggest global hubs of technology and consider a World Leader For Artificial Intelligence. Here you can see food-serving robots humanoid robots.</p>

<p>Maintaining a perfect balance in the economic, social &amp; environmental domain with a futuristic vision and non-stop development entices people from different parts of the world to invest in Dubai.</p>

<p><strong>Competitive Prices And Rental Yields</strong></p>

<p>Price of residential properties in Dubai are very low and return on investment &amp; rental yields are very high if you compare it with top cities in the world like New York and London. Indeed, it&rsquo;s a plus point that every location in Dubai is attractive with its own USP and every residential project here is outstanding and offers outstanding returns. And the same time, residential properties in Dubai with a low and zero property tax could lead to excellent ROI.&nbsp; And if you invest in top neighbourhoods of Dubai like Dubai Downtown, Business Bay, Dubai Marina, Palm Jumeirah and Damac Lagoons and Dubai South etc. then you can expect a double-digit return on investment.</p>

<p><strong>Strategic Location</strong></p>

<p>Dubai city has created everything itself to stand ahead of other top cities in the world, but its strategic location is God-gifted. This location is stand equidistance from both directions East &amp; West and work as a natural bridge between producers, manufacturers, and consumers of the world.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Economic growth and stability</strong></p>

<p>Another big reason to consider Dubai for real estate investment is rising economic growth and stability. Positioned equidistant from East and West, this region serves as a meeting point for Eastern &amp; Western businesses. A perfect region from where you can expand your business in both directions. Thanks to the efforts of the UAE government to establish Dubai as the centre point of commerce in the middle east, its economy has since tremendously boosted in different economic sectors and experienced unbelievable capital growth.</p>

<p>According to different insights &amp; data, the UAE economy is performing top of the Arab World with a growth of 3.8% in 2021 and expected to reach 5.4% at the end of 2022.</p>

And if we talk about the future of Dubai real estate on the basis of existing infrastructural, technological &amp; economical advancements then it is very hard to predict, because the possibilities are incredible and endless.</p>

                                    <h2>How To Invest in Dubai Real Estate?</h2>
                                    <p>This part of the write-up is dedicated to novice ex-pats &amp; foreigners who are planning to invest in Dubai property. Here are some of the important points they must know before starting their property buying process.</p>

<p><strong>1. Finding Property</strong></p>

<p>Definitely, this is the first step of your real estate investment in Dubai. Now the biggest question here is, how to find the best property in Dubai if you are living somewhere else? Read the given below points.</p>

<p><strong>1.1 Determine What Type Of Property You Are Interested In</strong></p>

<p>First of all you need to know, what is available for sale in freehold areas. There are studios, apartments, villas &amp; townhouses available for sale in Dubai freehold areas. Freehold areas are the designated regions by UAE Government where foreigners &amp; ex-pats can buy, lease or sell properties. So, you need to discuss this with your family members or investment experts and determine what property type is best for you.</p>

<p><strong>1.2 Start Searching Online</strong></p>

<p>As inexperienced foreign home seekers you can start your searching online. There are countless online real estate websites for Dubai Housing or Properties, to get an idea about property prices, and neighbourhoods. You can buy properties from these websites too, as these property websites belong to reputed real estate developers or their channel partners. Websites of channel partners/real estate agents comprise the best options from developers in Dubai at the best price and zero commission.</p>

<p><strong>1.3 Contact Specialist Agents</strong></p>

<p>No matter how smart you are, if you are looking for the best property in Dubai, you must contact specialist real estate agents. These specialist agents keep themself updated on every big or small happening in their field and can find the best property options in your budget. And as I mentioned in the upper point, most of the agents are the channel partners of big real estate developers, so you don&rsquo;t have to pay any commission or fees to them.</p>

<p><strong>1.4 Attend Property Fairs</strong></p>

<p>As you know that infrastructural developments in Dubai are ahead of time and Dubai real estate is still relatively young. There are many developments here that are still off-plan or in planning stages. You can invest in these developments as the property price here is affordable with guaranteed high ROI in the future. So real estate developers are continuously organising property fairs to showcase these developments and meet their potential buyers. You can check the licence of real estate developers on Dubai Land Development Website and verify the projects with RERA no.</p>

<p><strong>1.5 Visit Dubai</strong></p>

<p>Last but important step which you should never skip. Before finalising any property in Dubai be sure that you know the locations &amp; neighbourhoods and this is only possible if you visit Dubai. If you are looking for a ready-to-move property in Dubai then you must check as many as properties you can and don&rsquo;t hesitate to ask questions from sellers.</p>

<p><strong>Pro Tips:-&nbsp;</strong>If you are looking for off-plan under-construction properties, then you should visit the other ready-to-move properties from the same developers.</p>

<p><strong>2. Meeting Eligibility</strong></p>

<p>Now is one of the most important points for property buying in Dubai. There are some eligibilities which you must fulfil before buying a property in Dubai. So, let&#39;s know about these eligibilities.</p>

<p><strong>2.1 Have The Required Id And Visa Documents</strong></p>

<p>Thanks to the changes of law in 2002&rsquo;s freehold property laws, it has become possible for foreigners to buy &amp; rent property in Dubai. As a foreign property buyer, you just need to show your valid passport to prove your identity. You can buy property in Dubai without any residency permit but if you want to stay here then you need to take care of this.</p>

<p>The United Arab Emirates government has a 6-month visa as a &ldquo;Property Holders Visa&rdquo; for property buyers.</p>

<p>Property Holders Visa allows 6 months stay for foreign investors for investment investigation.</p>

<p>If your property has a value of more than AED 1 million then you can apply for this visa as an individual, not as a company.</p>

<p><strong>2.2 Determine The Full Costs</strong></p>

<p>Property buying is one of the biggest financial commitments in everyone&rsquo;s life. When it comes to the property in Dubai you need to be sure whether you can afford it or not. Property not only comes with an asking price but there are many other costs too that you should include in your budget.</p>

<p><strong>Extra charges you need to consider:-</strong></p>

<p><strong>2.3 Get A Mortgage In Dubai</strong></p>

<p>For foreigners, there are several eligibility criteria to obtain mortgages in Dubai. You will need to submit several documents and some additional documents based on your nationality and the property type you are purchasing.</p>

<p>Generally, foreign applicants will have to provide the given below documents for the home loan in Dubai.</p>

<ul>
	<li>Passport as Identity proof</li>
	<li>Bank statement as proof of funds</li>
</ul>

<p>Additional documents to get the home loan for foreign home buyers</p>

<ul>
	<li>Tax returns in some cases</li>
	<li>Salary slip (for the salaried person)</li>
	<li>Business licence &amp; transaction statements (for the businessman)</li>
	<li>Details of any existing loans</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>3. Buying &ldquo;Off-Plan&rdquo; Property</strong></p>

<p>Off-plan property is a perfect decision, especially for foreigners, but it can be a cause of concern if you are not clear about the process &amp; important steps. So, let&rsquo;s talk about the process &amp; steps.</p>

<p><strong>3.1 Submit A Reservation Form</strong></p>

<p>So far you know how much you can spend and find a perfect off-plan property in Dubai. Now the first step you need to take is submitting a reservation form. This reservation form will explain the terms &amp; conditions, payment plans, and other important information about developments, and seller &amp; buyer information.</p>

<p><strong>Important points to keep in mind:-</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>You need to submit copies of your Passport &amp; Visa with the reservation form.</li>
	<li>You must check the property status (leasehold or freehold) before submitting the reservation form.</li>
	<li>You must understand the details in the reservation form before signing &amp; submitting it. (don&rsquo;t hesitate to take the help of a professional).</li>
	<li>Check the RERA registration no. of the property.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>3.2 Pay The Reservation Deposit</strong></p>

<p>With the submission of the reservation form you will have to pay the reservation amount (booking amount). This amount is mentioned in your reservation form, it will generally range between 5% to 20% + 4% DLD charges.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong>&nbsp;When you are paying a reservation deposit, just check that payments you make are transferred into RERA-approved</p>

<p><strong>3.3 Complete A Formal Sales And Purchase Agreement</strong></p>

<p>A legal binding contract is a formal purchase agreement in written form between two parties (seller &amp; buyer). Make sure this agreement is the date by which the possession handover should be done. As well as, check the penalties for the developer if they fail to fulfil the commitments. In this case, an experienced lawyer can help you in understand the contract, and check every small detail, term &amp; condition.</p>

<p><strong>3.4 Transfer the deeds</strong></p>

<p>To complete the off-plan property buying process you must transfer the deeds. For this, you have to pay 100% of the property price. If you fail to do so then deeds will not be transferred. If you are buying ready-to-move property then the transfer will happen in the Dubai Land Department office. And if it is near the possession date then the transfer will happen in the developer&rsquo;s office.</p>

<p><strong>4. Buying &ldquo;Resale&rdquo; Property</strong></p>

<p>Resale property is the perfect choice for individuals who can&rsquo;t wait for possession. And the good thing is that, you don&rsquo;t have to pay rent on other apartments, just pay the property price and start living. But just like off-plan residential properties, there are some steps that you need to follow. So, let&rsquo;s start&hellip;</p>

<p><strong>4.1 Make A Memorandum Of Understanding</strong></p>

<p>The first &amp; important step of buying resale property in Dubai and many other regions. To buy a resale property you must agree with the seller&rsquo;s terms, and record this in a Memorandum of Understanding with the signatures of the buyer &amp; seller. MoU is the basic document that outlines terms &amp; conditions with the date of final purchase.</p>

<p><strong>4.2 Pay The Initial Deposit</strong></p>

<p>Just after the signing of the MoU buyers have to pay the initial deposit (booking amount). This initial deposit (generally 10% of the total amount) is non-refundable under any conditions (sometime depends on the bonding between buyer &amp; seller).</p>

<p><strong>4.3 Obtain The Deeds</strong></p>

<p>With an agreement &amp; arrangements of funds you can approach the seller to complete the deal and get the possession. As a foreigner, you will be required to pay the complete property price, just like off-plan properties. To obtain the deeds, you may need to take an appointment with the DLD office and present there with all necessary documents.</p>

                                    <h2>Dubai Real Estate Laws And Regulations</h2>
                                    <p>Now we all admit that Dubai is one of the best cities not only in UAE but all over the world. It is considered a top real estate investment and holiday destination due to its contemporary architectural design and high-rise towers. The world&rsquo;s wealthiest people choose Dubai to buy their super luxurious homes.</p>

<p>Dubai State Government has introduced real estate laws and regulations for home buyers and investors from all over the world. These laws and regulations take care of every legal concern concerning the buy, sell, and rent. Let&rsquo;s talk about these rules &amp; regulations in detail.</p>

<p><strong>Real Estate Ownership In Dubai For Foreign Nationals</strong></p>

<p>Law number 3 of 2006 Foreigners (non-UAE/GCC nation als) can only buy property in freehold areas with leasehold up to 99 years. This rule also applies to foreign companies, subject to the DLD&rsquo;s guidelines on the title to real estate that is applicable from 1 January 2011. As well as, any foreigner can acquire a lease in the regions that come not under these appointed areas&nbsp;<strong>(Law Number 7 of 2006).</strong></p>

<p><strong>Transfer fees payable by foreigners in Dubai</strong></p>

<p>4% DLD fee of the total value of the property is payable to the Dubai Land Department to register a transfer of residential property in Dubai. This fee is the same for everyone whether you are a foreigner, UAE/GCC nationals, or any company buying the property.</p>

<p>As well as, after the registration of the transfer, any alteration in the shareholding (at any level up to the ultimate beneficial owner) of the foreign company buyer is considered a transfer of the property requiring payment of an extra transfer fee at the DLD.</p>

<p><strong>Why A Buyer Or Investor Must Be Aware Of Dubai Property Laws?</strong></p>

<p>Real estate investors &amp; buyers from different parts of the world show huge interest in Dubai properties. But most of these buyers are unaware of the local rules &amp; regulations of Dubai real estate and make many mistakes. There are many laws in Dubai real estate that protect the interests of buyers &amp; sellers of the property, self-help is the best help and one must know these rules before buying property.</p>

<p><strong>Dubai Property Law</strong></p>

<p>Transactions in Dubai real estate are controlled by some rules &amp; regulations meant to protect the interest of foreign property buyers. Law No. 5 of 1985 controls civil transactions and holds many provisions relating to property and provides protection of private property and laws relating to the property title.&nbsp; DLD (The Department of Land and Property in Dubai) create the necessary rules &amp; regulations for real estate in Dubai. Founded in 1960 with the intention to increase transparency &amp; faith in Dubai Real Estate.</p>

<p><strong>Real Estate Law Number Seven</strong></p>

<p>The Government of Dubai introduced Law No. 7 of 2006 to limit the restriction on Non-UAE &amp; GCC nationals related to property ownership in Dubai. In the absence of this law, foreigners were not able to hold the owner of any property in Dubai. But with the existence of this law now Foreigners can also take ownership of property on lease or rent. The maximum lease duration for any property is 99 years which must get approved by the DLD department.</p>

<p><strong>Rental Property Laws</strong></p>

<p>Real Estate Regulatory Agency (RERA) of Dubai has introduced many laws to protect the interest of landlord-tenant. Some of the important laws are given below:</p>

<p><strong>Landlord rights</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>Article 15 defines that, at the time of handover to the tenant, the property must be in good condition and permit its full use according to the contract.</li>
	<li>According to Article 16, repair &amp; maintenance work in the rented property is the responsibility of the landlord.</li>
	<li>According to Article 17 - a landlord shouldn&rsquo;t make any modification or conduct renovations in the property that would directly or indirectly affect the interests of the tenant;</li>
	<li>According to Article 18, a landlord has to provide all the required licences &amp; permits to the tenant for any relevant modification or construction activity on the property.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Tenant Rights</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>According to Article 19 if the tenant wants to do some modification to the property then the landlord has to provide permission &amp; licenses if required;</li>
	<li>According to Article 20, while renting the property the tenant has to pay a reimbursable amount as a security deposit. If the landlord refuses to give back the deposit either fully or partially, then the tenant can knock on the court door.</li>
	<li>Article 21 defines that the tenant must hand over the property to the landlord in the same condition they have received it during the signing of the agreement.</li>
	<li>Article 22 clears that tenant must clear all the taxes &amp; charges of government departments and entities associated with the use of the property; this also comprises sub-lease, except if the conditions are different in the rental agreement;</li>
	<li>According to Article 23 - while leaving the property and handover to the landlord, the tenant must dismount the structural modifications they have made.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Inheritance Property Law</strong></p>

<p>As the word &ldquo;inheritance&rdquo; define transferring of one&rsquo;s assets to their descendants or legally entitled beneficiaries. But what happens if the deceased person has not written any will? If this happens in UAE then an Interstate Court decides how a property should be distributed in the middle of family members or state will owe that property. That&rsquo;s why if you are foreign investors or home buyers in Dubai then you must have a will to transfer your assets to the right persons.</p>
