                                                            <article id="TypesOfInvestmentAvailableInDubai" class="blog_content">
                                    <h2>Types Of Investment Available In Dubai </h2>
                                    <p>Investment can be a daunting task, so one should be attentive enough to place the capital at the right place, and here we open up 7 segments for investment opportunities in Dubai.</p>

<ul>
	<li>Real Estate</li>
	<li>Stocks</li>
	<li>National Bonds</li>
	<li>Mutual Funds</li>
	<li>Funds</li>
	<li>Cryptocurrency</li>
	<li>Gold</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>1. Real Estate</strong></p>

<p>Real estate with rapid economic growth and high tourism and most importantly, Dubai promises highest rental yield, so this is gleaning more attention of the home buyers and investors both. Besides this, Expo 2020 got a huge impact on the major sectors of Dubai, along with this, population growth and rapid development in the real estate development where the top notch builders are coming up with different projects fully loaded with different amenities &amp; features.</p>

<p>EMAAR, Sobha, Danube, DAMAC and more presents their best projects which creates a leeway for the investors and home buyers.</p>

<p><strong>PROS - Financial stability and better appreciation over time</strong></p>

<p><strong>CONS - &nbsp;Involve big investment and bear maintenance cost</strong></p>

<p><strong>2. Stock&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>For short and quick investment stocks are considered way better, and in Dubai, there are 2 stock exchanges- Dubai Financial Market &amp; NASDAQ Dubai, but here investment should be done on own risk.</p>

<p>National bonds are good option with a minimum AED 100 and multiples of 100 AED. So investment in bonds is more effective and suitable option compared to other investment options, bonds are debt instrument issued by companies with interest against it.</p>

<p><strong>PROS - Faster growth with economy and easy to buy &amp; sell</strong></p>

<p><strong>CONS - Risk of intact capital loss and high brokerage rates</strong></p>

<p><strong>3. Mutual Funds</strong></p>

<p>For long term investment mutual funds are a lucrative option with a minimum investment. Systematic Investment Plan (SIP) where one can put in a certain amount on monthly bases for a short period of time, in addition to this, it is low cost investment that requires USD 200 which is easily manageable for many.</p>

<p><strong>HSBC, standard Chartered, ADCB, Mashreq, CBD and more provides mutual funds.</strong></p>

<p><strong>PROS - Available with limited funds and liquidity</strong></p>

<p><strong>CONS - Longer lock in periods and sustain management cost</strong></p>

<p><strong>4. Funds</strong></p>

<p>Funds come under two ranges- Domestic &amp; international, and for funds it is in different kinds- fixed income fund, value &amp; growth funds, sector funds, active &amp; passive funds, sharia compliant or non-compliant funds, equity funds and more. So as per the need you can opt for the right fund.</p>

<p><strong>PROS - Curtails the risk and fair pricing</strong></p>

<p><strong>CONS - Requires pro trade execution and tax inefficiency</strong></p>

<p><strong>5. Gold&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>Dubai is a hub of gold where the exclusion of tax on gold makes it comparatively cheaper than other, so investment in gold can never be a false investment in fact, here you get a freedom to buy small gram of gold and at the right point of time you can sell it.</p>

<p>So out of 7 if you are skeptical for your decision, then gold is the lucrative way to secure capital as it requires minimum amount and zero risk because gold has had been in demand and there is no replacement of it, and in addition to this, in Dubai, you get tax free gold which is benefit itself and also it strengthens the existing capital.</p>

<p><strong>PROS - Easy to liquefy and global demand</strong></p>

<p><strong>CONS - Needs physical storage and deduction of making charges</strong></p>

<p><strong>6. Cryptocurrency</strong></p>

<p>Cryptocurrency is a medium of exchange just like a standard currency, but this is based on digital binary data. And now everyone is accepting this currency for payments, and like other countries, UAE has allowed the usage, and this further unlocks the doors for investors who are seeking secured &amp; quick investment (manageable).</p>

<p><strong>PROS - Self Governed &amp; managed and even transparent</strong></p>

<p><strong>CONS - &nbsp;Risk of data loss and misuse of digital scams</strong></p>

<p><strong>7. National Bonds</strong></p>

<p>It is initiated by Dubai government where they have 50% ownership and it aims low risk savings to people in the UAE by offering Sharia Compliant scheme. And it is one of the preferred investment as it serves fixed income gains with liquidity, attractive interest rate and safety.</p>

<p>Minimum hold is for 3 months and after this you can redeem them across the country and minimum it requires AED 100.</p>

<p><strong>PROS - Less risk and fixed returns of investment</strong></p>

<p><strong>CONS - &nbsp;Prices curtail when interest rate takes a rise and low liquidity</strong></p>

<p>So above mentioned investment options in Dubai outspreads better opportunities for expatriate and inpatriate where they can kick out the best investment options that offer pool of benefits in the present and future, but nothing can beat a lucrative mind, so whatever you plan for keep its percentage of risk in mind too.</p>

<p>No matter what type of investment you plan in Dubai but there is always a risk where you need to have a meticulous mind and approach to find out the Smart option for investment. And when it is related to finance the risk is obvious, but surely with effect approach you can curtail its percentage.</p>

<p><strong>A Perfect Saying - No Risk, No Gain&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p><strong>So even with the certain level of risk in the investment you need to follow 7 standard rules of investing:-</strong></p>

<ul>

	<li>Long term of short term?</li>
