                                    <h2>Time To Apply For Housing Assistance, But How?</h2>
                                    <p>So for this you need to arrange the following documents and ensure that they all are valid:-</p>

<ul>
	<li>A copy of the family book</li>
	<li>Passport and identity card</li>
	<li>Real estate property certificate issued by the competent authority&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Commercial licenses certificated issued by the same authority</li>
	<li>Proof of your income where you can submit a salary certificate, financial aid certificate or proof that the applicant has no income</li>
</ul>

<p>And in case a divorced woman wants to apply should get a certificate issued by the competent court providing her custody of her children.</p>

<ul>
	<li>Non marriage certificate&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Certificate showing the retirement pension on behalf of her deceased husband</li>
</ul>

<p>And now the ministry may train the applicant to submit any information, or documents within a time not exceeding 90 days from the date of the request, otherwise, it may not be valid. Apart from this, a housing assistance application shall be refused if all documents are not attached or valid, so the correctness of the data is ensured by the ministry, and if the wrong data is given intentionally, then the housing assistance will be withdrawn.&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
	<li>Fill out and submit the application form</li>
	<li>Announcement of the name of the candidate for housing assistance</li>
	<li>Bring the documents of the applicant&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Cross check every submitted document</li>
	<li>Program board approval</li>
	<li>Announcing the final approvals with the help of the media</li>
</ul>

<p>And then simply with the help of an official website you can follow up the application by entering the user name and password.</p>

<p>Then if you are concerned about the value of the loan, then the value of the housing assistance maximum limit for a grant or loan is 800,000 dirhams, and for assistance for governmental housing or housing loan within a residential complex depending on the cost of the establishment of the house and it should not exceed 800,000 dirhams.</p>

<p>The monthly income limit of the grand recipient applies to a person whose average monthly income is less than 15,000 dirhams. And note, The Council of Ministers may change the value of the housing assistance and the monthly income for the recipient of the financial grant, and this is entirely based on the economic conditions, prices of goods &amp; services, inflation rates and proposal by the minister.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Now, what if you want to cancel your application? So the documents that are required are the family book along with filling out the cancellation request.&nbsp;</p>
